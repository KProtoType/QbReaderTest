# Viewing the Quiz Bowl Practice Documentation on GitHub Pages

This repository contains HTML documentation that can be viewed directly online through GitHub Pages.

## Documentation Pages

You can view the documentation at:

- **Main Documentation**: https://kprototype.github.io/QbReaderTest/
- **Installation Guide**: https://kprototype.github.io/QbReaderTest/installation-guide.html
- **User Guide**: https://kprototype.github.io/QbReaderTest/user-guide.html

## What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that allows GitHub repositories to serve HTML content directly as websites. When enabled:

1. The content of your repository becomes accessible at `https://username.github.io/repository-name/`
2. The `index.html` file in the root directory becomes the homepage
3. Other HTML files are accessible at their relative paths

## Enabling GitHub Pages for This Repository

To make these documentation pages viewable online:

1. Go to the repository settings (click "Settings" tab at the top of the repository page)
2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
3. Under "Source", select "main" branch
4. Click "Save"

It may take a few minutes for the site to become available after enabling GitHub Pages.

## Important Note

The documentation pages are designed to help users understand and use the Quiz Bowl Practice App. However, the actual app itself requires running a local server with Node.js as described in the Installation Guide. The GitHub Pages site only provides documentation and cannot run the actual application.
